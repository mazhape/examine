// Compilation error

//The correct answer is (c). This question tries to trick you with complex code that
//doesnâ€™t use any if constructs or do-while loops! As you can see, it uses an incorrect
//data type name, bool, to declare and initialize the variable result. Therefore, the
//code will fail to compile.
