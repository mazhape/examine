//Select the options that, when inserted at // INSERT CODE HERE, will make the following code output a value of 11:
package Javadatatype.SampleExamQuestions;

public class IncrementNum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int ctr = 50;
        // INSERT CODE HERE
        System.out.println(ctr % 20);
    }
}

//a ctr += 1;
//c ++ctr;

//Explanation: To output a value of 11, the value of the variable ctr should be 51
//because 51%20 is 11. Operator % outputs the remainder from a division operation. The
//current value of the variable ctr is 50. It can be incremented by 1 using the correct
//assignment or increment operator.
// Option (b) is incorrect. Java does not define a =+ operator. The correct operator
//is +=.Option (d) is incorrect because itâ€™s assigning a value of 1 to the variable result,
//not incrementing it by 1.
