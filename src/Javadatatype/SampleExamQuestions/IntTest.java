//Compilation error
//Explanation: First of all, whenever you answer any question that uses parentheses to
//override operator precedence, check whether the number of opening parentheses
//matches the number of closing parentheses. This code won’t compile because the
//number of opening parentheses doesn’t match the number of closing parentheses.
// Second, you may not have to answer complex expressions in the real exam. Whenever you see overly complex code, look for other possible issues in the code. Complex
//code may be used to distract your attention from the real issue.
