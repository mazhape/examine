//Explanation: Option a is incorrect because #connect isn’t a statement in Java. # is
//used to add comments in UNIX.
// Option b is incorrect because a package name (Java compiler) can’t contain
//spaces. Also, java virtual machine isn’t a valid package name to be imported in a
//class. The package name to be imported can’t contain spaces.
// Option c is incorrect because a package statement (if present) must be placed
//before an import statement.
// Option e is incorrect. #package and $import aren’t valid statements or directives
//in Java.
// Option f is incorrect. Java is case-sensitive, so the word class is not the same as the
//word Class. The correct keyword to define a class is class.
