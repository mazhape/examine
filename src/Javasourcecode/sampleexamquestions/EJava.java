package Javasourcecode.sampleexamquestions;

 class EJava {
     //

//Answer: None of the above

//Explanation: A class that isn’t defined in a package gets implicitly defined in Java’s
//default package. But such classes can’t be accessed by classes or interfaces, which are
//explicitly defined in a package.
