//"Hello World"
//Theoretically, java supports Pass by Value for everything ( i.e. primitives as well as Objects).
//
//Remember that:
//1. Primitives are always passed by value.
//2. Object "references" are passed by value. So it looks like the object is passed by reference but actually it is the value of the reference that is passed.
//
//        An  example:
//      Object o1 = new Object();
//
//Let us say, this object is stored at memory location 15000.  Since o1 actually stores just the address of the memory location where the object is stored, it contains 15000.
//
//Now, when you call someMethod(o1); the value 15000 is passed to the method.  Therefore, this is what happens inside the method someMethod():
//
//
//       someMethod( Object localVar) {
//localVar now contains 15000, which means localVar also points to the same memory location where the object is stored. Therefore, when you call a method on localVar, it will be executed on the same object.
//
//However, when you change the value of localVar itself, for example, if you do localVar=null,  then localVar starts pointing to a different memory location. But the original variable o1 still  contains 15000 so it still points to the same object.
//        }
