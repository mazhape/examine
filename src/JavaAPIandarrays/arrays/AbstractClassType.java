//What‚Äôs Going On Here?
//Vehicle is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly.
//Car and Bus are concrete subclasses of Vehicle.
//Vehicle[] vehicleArray is declared to hold references to Vehicle (or any subclass of Vehicle).

//üîë Analysis of the Array Contents:

//Index	             Value	  Valid?	Explanation
//vehicleArray[0]	new Car()	‚úÖ	     Car is a subclass of Vehicle
//vehicleArray[1]	new Bus()	‚úÖ	     Bus is also a subclass of Vehicle
//vehicleArray[2]	null	    ‚úÖ	     null is a valid value for any reference type

//OCA Exam Angle
//You can declare an array of an abstract class.
//You can store objects of subclasses inside it.
//Null values are allowed.
//You cannot do this:

//Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // ‚ùå Compilation error
