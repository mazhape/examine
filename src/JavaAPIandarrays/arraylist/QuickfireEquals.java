}

//âœ… Correct Answer: A
//Explanation:
//This compiles, but doesn't override Object.equals(Object) because the signature is different (equals(A) instead of equals(Object)). So it's not a valid override â€” just an overloaded method.

//âœ… Correct Answer: B
//Explanation:
//This is a valid override of equals(Object) and follows the contract loosely â€” it just checks type compatibility. It does compile and works, though it could be more thorough (e.g. checking fields).

//âœ… Correct Answer: B
//Explanation:
//Yes! It compiles, but is not safe because there's no instanceof check. If obj isn't a C, it'll throw ClassCastException. You nailed it.

//âœ… Correct Answer: D
//Explanation:
//This compiles and checks for null, but doesn't check if obj is a D, so it can throw a ClassCastException. You almost had it!


//âœ… Correct Answer: D (All of the above)
//Explanation:
//This is the textbook correct way to override equals:
//It checks for type safety.
//Avoids NullPointerException.
//Compares relevant data. You got the compile part right, but missed that it also follows the contract and is safe.
